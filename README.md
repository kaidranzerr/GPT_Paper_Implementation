Shakespearean Text Generation with Novel GPT & Transformer Implementation

This project explores a novel approach to generating text in the style of William Shakespeare using a combination of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and Transformer architectures. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, enabling it to capture the unique characteristics of his language and produce creative text formats that mimic his writing style.

Key Features:

Novel Architecture: Combines elements of GPT and Transformers for potentially improved performance in text generation tasks.
Shakespearean Text Style: Trained on Shakespeare's works, allowing the model to generate text that reflects his vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure.
Text Generation: Produces creative text formats in the style of Shakespeare, suitable for various applications like generating sonnets, poems, or dialogue snippets.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.6 or later
PyTorch (tested with version 1.x)
Additional libraries may be required based on the specific implementation
